  // Task
  // Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
  //
  // In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer;
  // in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
  //
  // The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.
  //
  // Examples
  // -1  =>  false
  // 0  =>  true
  // 3  =>  false
  // 4  =>  true
  // 25  =>  true
  // 26  =>  false
